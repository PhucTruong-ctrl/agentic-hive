# `hive-install` — portable Agentic Hive installer

`install/hive-install` is the non-NixOS equivalent of `nix/module.nix`. It
installs the Hive commands and shared assets under a prefix, creates the
non-root `hive` account and habitat root, and writes the systemd units, sudoers
rule, login profile, Claude Code hooks and tmux drop-in. All OS-specific
knowledge lives here; `bin/` and `share/` stay distro-agnostic.

```sh
sudo install/hive-install --beekeeper alice
sudo install/hive-install --beekeeper alice --port 80 --address 0.0.0.0
sudo install/hive-install --beekeeper alice --uninstall
```

| Option | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--beekeeper <user>` | — (required) | Human account added to group `hive` and granted NOPASSWD sudo to the hive user. |
| `--hive-user <name>` | `hive` | Habitat account to create. |
| `--hive-group <name>` | `hive` | Habitat group to create. |
| `--hive-root <dir>` | `/srv/hive` | Mutable habitat root (setgid 2770 + default ACL). |
| `--prefix <dir>` | `/usr/local` | Prefix for commands (`bin`) and assets (`share/agentic-hive`). |
| `--port <n>` | `8080` | Dashboard port. Below 1024 adds `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` to `hive-web.service`. |
| `--address <addr>` | `127.0.0.1` | Dashboard bind address. Non-loopback drives member terminals and a host shell as the hive user, so a warning is printed. |
| `--no-web` | off | Skip `hive-web.service`. |
| `--no-hooks` | off | Skip `/etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json`. |
| `--no-deps` | off | Skip package installation (the package list is still printed). |
| `--dry-run` | off | Print every action as `would ...`, change nothing. |
| `--uninstall` | off | Restore owned files and remove only accounts/groups created by this installer. |

The root-only journal at `/var/lib/agentic-hive-install` records original files
and account ownership across reinstalls. Use the same account, habitat, prefix,
and Beekeeper options when uninstalling. Without a journal, uninstall refuses
to guess ownership. Account homes and habitat data are always retained.

Claude hooks are merged into existing managed settings. Existing permissions,
hooks, and status lines are preserved. Uninstall restores the original file
when unchanged; if policy was edited later, it removes only Hive's hooks and
status line. Other modified installed files are retained.
| `-h`, `--help` | — | Usage. |

## Staging with `DESTDIR`
`DESTDIR` writes every absolute path under that prefix and skips user/group
creation, tmpfiles application, `systemctl` and package installation, so an
unprivileged user can build a staged tree:
`DESTDIR=/tmp/stage install/hive-install --beekeeper alice`.

## Adding a package-manager family
Each family is one row in `family_row()`: `<install command>|<packages>`.
Detection (`pkg_family()`) is by which binary exists; add one case arm with the
family's package names — no other code changes.
